# Face-Mask-CNN
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JosephJeong6234/Face-Mask-CNN/main/facecnndemo.mp4

I used a kaggle dataset to make a cnn classifer on mask vs no mask wearing people. 
I used 2 convolution layers, first had 32 channels and the second had 64. 
I used ReLU to make the outputs non linear and pooling to make it more efficent with 5 epochs. 
Had a test accuracy of 98.79%
